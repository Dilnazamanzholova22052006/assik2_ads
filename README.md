# Dilnaz's ADS HW 2

This project demonstrates the implementation of custom data structures: `MyArrayList` and `MyDoublyLinkedList`. These classes provide similar functionality to Java's built-in ArrayList and LinkedList but are implemented from scratch for learning purposes.

## How to Launch the Project

1. **Open in IDE**: Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

2. **Run the Main Class**: Inside the `src` directory, navigate to the `Main.java` file. Run this file to execute the demonstration of the custom data structures.

## Demo

To see a demonstration of the working classes, follow these steps after launching the project:

1. Open the `Main.java` file located in the `src` directory.

2. Run the `Main` class. This will execute various operations on both `MyArrayList` and `MyDoublyLinkedList`, demonstrating their functionality.

3. Observe the console output for the results of the operations performed on the custom data structures.
